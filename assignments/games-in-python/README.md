# 📘 Assignment: Hangman Game

## 🎯 Objective

In this assignment, you'll build the classic word-guessing game Hangman using Python. You'll practice string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and random selection to create an interactive game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Build the Core Game Logic

#### Description
Create the main game logic that allows players to play a complete round of Hangman. The game should randomly select a word from a predefined list, accept player guesses, and manage game state throughout the gameplay.

#### Requirements
Your game must:

- Randomly select words from a predefined list
- Accept letter guesses from the player via user input
- Track and display current progress in the format: `_ _ _`
- Track incorrect guesses and remaining attempts
- Validate input to handle invalid entries gracefully
- End the game when the word is guessed or attempts are exhausted
- Display clear win/lose messages at the end
